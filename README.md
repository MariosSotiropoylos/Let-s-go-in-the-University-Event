# Event Websites
- The websites that can be seen above were designed with use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
Due to their use of hypertextuality and interactivity, they were used as means of providing information to the visitors of the event, whose main goal was to showcase our Department to 
(possibly) future students. 

- It should be mentioned that these sites were designed with a computer screen as basis, NOT phone ot tablet screens
* Modification will be considered in future revisions
